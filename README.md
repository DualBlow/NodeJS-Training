# NodeJS-Training

## This repo contains my Node.JS learning journey.

- At first, I am going to focus on learing how to use NodeJS to initiallize and Use RESTful API
- Second goal is to transition to Typescript and mongo DB in order to learn the required skills for back-end development.

## index.js

1. ### First thing I did was to initialize a RESTful-API with simple functionallity using Node.JS with Express.JS. 
  - Simple response to the GET Request
  - Simple response of the parameters on the POST Request.
